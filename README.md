# Social Media API

## Description: 

Using MongoDB and Mongoose, this application creates the back end database for a social media application. The API routes have been set up so you can create a POST request to create a new user, a new thought for this user, and other users can POST their reaction's to a user's thought. Additionally, a POST request can be used to create friendships between two users. Users and thoughts can be updated using a PUT request. All fields, including Users, Thoughts, Reactions, and Friendships can be deleted. Please see the Testing section of the ReadMe for more information on how to test these routes. Also, GET routes have been set up so you can view all, or view a single, User and Thought. Reactions can be seen within each thought.
